    /// Signed messages are not necessary to provide message integrity (tamper evidence),
    /// or to prove the sender to the recipient. Both of these guarantees automatically occur
    /// with the authenticated encryption in DIDComm encrypted messages. Signed messages are only
    /// necessary when the origin of plaintext must be provable to third parties,
    /// or when the sender canâ€™t be proven to the recipient by authenticated encryption because
    /// the recipient is not known in advance (e.g., in a broadcast scenario).
    /// We therefore expect signed messages to be used in a few cases, but not as a matter of course.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    /// - `sign_by` a DID or key ID the sender uses for signing
    /// - `did_resolver` instance of `DIDResolver` to resolve DIDs.
    /// - `secrets_resolver` instance of SecretsResolver` to resolve sender DID keys secrets
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// Tuple (signed_message, metadata)
    /// - `signed_message` a DIDComm signed message as JSON string
    /// - `metadata` additional metadata about this `encrypt` execution like used keys identifiers and algorithms.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// - `DIDNotResolved` Sender or recipient DID not found.
    /// - `DIDUrlNotResolved` DID doesn't contain mentioned DID Urls (for ex., key id)
    /// - `SecretNotFound` Sender secret is not found.
    /// - `InvalidState` Indicates library error.
    /// - `IOError` IO error during DID or secrets resolving
    /// TODO: verify and update errors list
