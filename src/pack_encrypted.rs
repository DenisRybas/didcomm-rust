    /// A DIDComm encrypted message is an encrypted JWM (JSON Web Messages) and
    /// hides its content from all but authorized recipients, discloses (optionally) and proves
    /// the sender to exactly and only those recipients, and provides integrity guarantees.
    /// It is important in privacy-preserving routing. It is what normally moves over network
    /// transports in DIDComm applications, and is the safest format for storing DIDComm data at rest.
    ///
    /// Encryption is done as following:
    ///  - Encryption is done via the keys from the `keyAgreement` verification relationship in the DID Doc
    ///  - if `to` is a DID, then multiplex encryption is done for all keys from the
    ///    receiver's `keyAgreement` verification relationship
    ///    which are compatible the sender's key.
    ///  - if `to` is a key ID, then encryption is done for the receiver's `keyAgreement`
    ///    verification method identified by the given key ID.
    ///  - if `from` is a DID, then sender `keyAgreement` will be negotiated based on recipient preference and
    ///    sender-recipient crypto compatibility.
    ///  - if `from` is a key ID, then the sender's `keyAgreement` verification method
    ///    identified by the given key ID is used.
    ///  - if `from` is None, then anonymous encryption is done and there will be no sender authentication property.
    ///
    /// It's possible to add non-repudiation by providing `sign_by` parameter.
    ///
    /// # Params
    /// - `to` recipient DID or key ID the sender uses encryption.
    /// - `from` a sender DID or key ID. If set message will be repudiable authenticated or anonymous otherwise.
    ///    Must match `from` header in Plaintext if the header is set.
    /// - `sign_by` if `Some` message will be additionally signed to provide additional non-repudiable authentication
    ///    by provided DID/Key. Signed messages are only necessary when the origin of plaintext must be provable
    ///    to third parties, or when the sender can’t be proven to the recipient by authenticated encryption because
    ///    the recipient is not known in advance (e.g., in a broadcast scenario).
    ///    Adding a signature when one is not needed can degrade rather than enhance security because
    ///    it relinquishes the sender’s ability to speak off the record.
    /// - `did_resolver` instance of `DIDResolver` to resolve DIDs.
    /// - `secrets_resolver` instance of SecretsResolver` to resolve sender DID keys secrets.
    /// - `options` allow fine configuration of packing process and have implemented `Default`.
